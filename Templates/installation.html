<p>Installing solar panels is a process that allows you to harness the power of the sun to generate electricity for your home or business. Here’s a simple step-by-step breakdown of how it works:
</p>

<p>1. Initial Consultation: First, we’ll assess your property to see if it’s a good fit for solar panels. This includes checking the roof's condition, orientation, and angle to make sure it gets enough sunlight.
</p>

<p>2. Design and Planning: Once we know your roof is suitable, our team will create a custom solar panel system design based on your energy needs. This is where we decide the number of panels, their placement, and how they will connect to your electrical system.
</p>

<p>3. Permits and Approvals: Before installation, we’ll handle all the necessary paperwork to get permits from your local authorities. This ensures everything meets building codes and safety standards.
</p>

<p>4. Installation Day: On the installation day, our trained technicians will arrive at your home. They’ll install the solar panels on your roof, ensuring they’re securely mounted and properly wired to the electrical system. This process usually takes a day or two, depending on the complexity.
</p>

<p>5. Inverter Installation: Solar panels generate DC (Direct Current) electricity, but your home uses AC (Alternating Current) electricity. An inverter is installed to convert the DC power to AC power, making it usable in your home.
</p>

<p>6. System Testing and Activation: After installation, we test the system to make sure everything works properly. Once everything is checked and functioning, we activate the system and you’re good to go!
</p>

<p>7. Monitoring and Maintenance: Once the system is up and running, we offer monitoring services so we can keep an eye on its performance. We also provide maintenance to ensure your panels continue to work efficiently for years.
